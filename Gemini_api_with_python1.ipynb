Their initial mission was to apprehend Loki, the god of mischief, and prevent him from launching an assault on Earth.\\n\\n**Golden Age and Cold War**\\n\\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the Avengers expanded their roster and fought against numerous threats, including the Masters of Evil, the Zodiac, and the Kree. The team also became embroiled in the Cold War, often clashing with the Soviet super-team, the Winter Guard.\\n\\n**Civil War and Disbandment**\\n\\nIn the early 2000s, the Avengers were divided over the Superhuman Registration Act, a law requiring all superhumans to register with the government. This led to a bitter conflict known as the \"Civil War,\" which resulted in the team\\'s temporary disbandment.\\n\\n**Reformation and Expansion**\\n\\nAfter the Civil War, the Avengers reformed under the leadership of Captain America, with a new roster that included Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Black Widow. The team also faced new challenges, such as the invasion of the Skrulls and the rise of Thanos, the mad Titan.\\n\\n**The Infinity Saga**\\n\\nThe Avengers played a pivotal role in the \"Infinity Saga,\" a series of films that culminated in \"Avengers: Endgame.\" They fought against Thanos and his army, who sought to collect the Infinity Stones and reshape the universe. After a series of sacrifices and setbacks, the Avengers eventually defeated Thanos and restored balance to the cosmos.\\n\\n**Post-Endgame Era**\\n\\nIn the post-\"Endgame\" era, the Avengers have undergone another roster change, with several original members retiring or leaving. The team now includes Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk, and Shang-Chi, among others. They continue to protect Earth from threats, both domestic and cosmic.\\n\\n**Additional Information**\\n\\n* The Avengers have a long-standing alliance with the Fantastic Four, another iconic superhero team.\\n* The team has been supported by various organizations, including S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers Tower.\\n* They have also faced numerous villains over the years, including Ultron, Kang the Conqueror, and Dormammu.\\n* The Avengers have been featured in numerous comic books, films, television shows, and video games.'"
